    <p>
      Your party arrives in Gruyere, a non-descript plains town known for their cheese.
      The townspeople emerge and see you - they stamp towards you, furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's gone and taken it! He's taken it all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      You attempt to console them, and ask for clarification.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Albanus! He's gone and stolen all of our cheese!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This simply won't do.

          "Thank you!" they shout, weeping with joy. "That cheese is our livelihood here in Gruyere!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The small crowd pushes you towards the center of the road, gesturing towards an open manhole cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Albanus lives down there!"
        </p>
          You're a bit unsure of where this is going, but you did agree to help them.

          You begin to swing your weapons and cast magicks indescriminately into the crowd.
          Needless to say, the town guard is NOT pleased by your actions...

              You've destroyed the last of the guards... although come to think of it, why were they
              wearing masks?
            </p>
            <p>
              Searching through the pockets of your fallen foes, you discover a worn map fragment that
              might solve this mystery.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fragment is a map of the town, with a big red X marked
              on several of the streets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Curious, you head to the nearest red X, finding an open manhole cover leading to the
              sewers below the town. The bandits must have come from down there.

    <p>
      The sewers smell precisely as bad as you imagined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But wafting on the air, you smell the distinctly foot-like stench of fresh Limburger.
      Albanus can't have gotten far.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you head deeper into the sewers, the light grows dark. A skittering sound ahead
      makes you think you're not the only one searching for a tasty morsel in these tunnels...

          The shadows begin to recede as you see a tall torch-bearing figure shuffle towards you.

          From the silhouette, you hear a deep voice.

        They rear away from you and begin attacking each other for the piece of cheese.

        As the figure runs towards your party, you succumb to your wounds and pass out.

      "Wot we gon' do wid em, Albanus?" a scratchy voice asks.

    <p>
      "Looks like they're from out of town. No one around here's gonna miss 'em." another colder voice replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      You open bleary eyes and behold a small cavern in the sewers. Albanus and his cronies
      are huddled by a fire in the center of the room. You and your troupe are off in a corner,
      battered and wounded but still among the living.

      You begin searching for some way out of this mess. You managed to slip your bonds - the bandits
      aren't very good at tying knots - and you immediately see two ways to ruin their day.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a small powder keg nearby. If it were to "accidentally" land in the fire, the walls would probably
      get a new coat of red paint. And soot.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also spy a giant rat in a cage, over in the corner. It looks malnourished and <i>very</i> hungry.

    <choice text="Toss the powder keg into the fire.">
      <roleplay title="Bang!">
        <p>
        The worry of setting off an explosion in a small, mostly-sealed room is dismissed from your mind as you
        grab the keg and lob it at the fire.
        </p>
        <p>
        You leap for cover as a blinding white light erupts, but are thrown to the wall, then to the ground by
        a massive wall of sound and heat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocks fall around you, but cheese - blasted high above by the explosion - falls as well. From the gaping hole in the ceiling you see the curious heads of the townsfolk gathering around to look at your stunned party and what is apparently a cheese-based weather phenomenon.
        </p>
        <p>
          You slump back to the ground, and pass out.

          Awakening some time later, you find yourself in Gruyere's apothecary house; the local herbalist took you in and treated your wounds, free of charge.

          "Good ting I was volking down da street ven you blew up da sewers!" she exclaimed. "Dere was da brie everywhere!"

          The herbalist tells you the town is safe from the sewer gang and everyone is grateful their cheese is safe once again, albeit a bit singed. You thank her for her assistance and gather your things, ready for your next journey.

          they're visibly shaken from seeing their comrade roasted alive.
