      <p>One player should read this page out loud, then pass the device to the next player.</p>
    </instruction>
    <p>"So, you want to go on an adventure?" the grizzly town guardsman asks with a smile.</p>
    <p>You, the trouble-making children of the town, nod eagerly.</p>
    <p>"Alrighty, then! Just don't tell your parents it was me!"</p>
    <instruction>
      <p>This is an instruction. You'll see these throughout quests, providing helpful tips and instructions for you to follow.</p>

  <roleplay icon="adventurer" title="Adventuring" data-line="14">
    <p>"Now, just remember - the most important rules when adventuring are to have fun and work together!"</p>
    <instruction>
      <p>Expedition is a lightweight game. It is focused on having fun instead of memorizing rules. For example, during a round of combat, you can resolve abilities in any order. You can even change the order of abilities after they've been played.</p>

  <roleplay icon="adventurer" title="The Quest" data-line="20">
    <p>"Now, you've got a decision to make! Would you rather help clean up the guardhouse, or deal with some rowdy fairy folk?"</p>
    <instruction>
      <p>At this point, your party should decide which option you'd like to pick. Your choices will affect your adventure, so choose wisely!</p>
    </instruction>
    <instruction>
      <p>There's no single way to win - each quest has its own goals and missions that will be revealed as you play.</p>

        <p>"Alright, knew that one would excite you. Here's the deal: a wisp and a mushroom are causing a commotion at the market. As honorary members of the town watch, you may use whatever force is necessary to bring peace to the town!"</p>
        <p>"Here, take this to help you." the guardsman hands you some loot from the guard supplies.</p>
        <instruction>
          <p>:loot: Draw two tier 1 loot cards face-up, and distribute them to party members as you see fit. You can give loot to other party members at any time.</p>
        </instruction>

        <p>You make your way to the market. The guardsman wasn't kidding about a commotion - you see floating magical mushrooms and wisps flying around, upsetting stalls and running into people.</p>

      <roleplay icon="fae" title="The Market" id="market" data-line="47">
        <p>The situation is bad. Bread lies broken on the ground. Merchants are mad. Tea leaves are trodden upon. Squashes are squashed!</p>
        <p>You consider your options:</p>

            <p>You march up to them, waving your wooden swords.</p>
            <p>"As honorary members of the town watch, we demand you stop disturbing the peace!"</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>They ignore you. You try again. "STOP!" you yell as loud as you can.</p>
            <p>Nothing. You'll have to try a different strategy.</p>
