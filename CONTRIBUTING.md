* [Pull requests](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) should be made to the [master branch](https://github.com/Fabricate-IO/expedition-cards/tree/master).

## Style Guide

We recommend developing in Sublime Text, and require that the following style settings be used. If you use a different text editor, make sure to follow the same requirements (that there is no whitespace at the end of lines or the end of the file, that all tabs use 2 spaces instead of the tab character):

```json
{
  "ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true,
  "tab_size": 2,
  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
  "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true
}
```
