## PNG ->SVG

When new art files are received from artists, they're often in PNG - but we want them to be in SVG for the best app + printing experience. To do so:

1. Turn the PNG art into pure black on transparent, such as using the Photoshop magic wand with 20 tolerance, anti - aliased. Then, use curves to force all set pixels to be black.
2. Use a tool like pngtosvg.com to convert it, with one color, to SVG.
3. Open it in Adobe Illustrator to adjust the viewbox as appropriate. If artboard is good, wiggle and save it (saving from Illustrator fixes file formatting).
4. Voila, art!
5. Optimize the files via instructions below, and add svgClass="noStroke" to the card sheet if the delicate parts are getting filled in

## Optimization

### General Optimization

Images should be resized such that the longest dimension is <= 2000 px.

### JPG Optimization

Generally save around quality 11 out of 12 for printed assets, 10 out of 12 for digital assets.

### PNG Optimization

Use something like https://compresspng.com, which can generally achieve a 50% compression and supports bulk processing.

### SVG Optimization

Use an SVG minification tool like https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/

Precision can generally set be pretty low (ie 2 / 10) unless it makes it look terrible.

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure to preserve the **viewBox** setting.
