# Expedition Art

The raw assets (such as .PSD and .AI) are stored separately in Google Drive to keep the repo compact.

## General Optimization

Images should be resized such that the longest dimension is <= 2000px.

## JPG Optimization

Generally save around quality 11 out of 12 for printed assets, 10 out of 12 for digital assets.

## PNG Optimization

Use something like https://compresspng.com/, which can generally achieve a 50% compression.

## SVG Optimization

Use an SVG minification tool like https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/

Precision can generally set be pretty low (ie 2/10) unless it makes it look terrible.

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure to preserve the **viewBox** setting.
