    <p>The sun shines through your curtains. As you groggily stir awake, you remember what day it is - the day of the village's annual spring cleaning!</p>
    <p>You shake awake, leap out of bed, and do some quick stretches to get your blood flowing. You grab your weapon from the side of your bed. You're ready to clean!</p>

  <roleplay title="The Ceremony" data-line="8">
    <p>You jog towards the opening ceremony. You know you should save your energy for the long day of cleaning ahead, but you're just too excited.</p>
    <p>The village's Lord gives his traditional speech - <i>blah blah, a clean dungeon is a healthy village, blah blah</i>. You're surrounded by other teams of warriors, fighters and adventurers, each double checking their gear and fidgeting with excitement.</p>
    <p>With a loud <b>"BEGIN!"</b>, the mob of people rushes into the nearby cave entrance.</p>

    <p>You charge into the dungeon, weapon drawn.</p>
    <p>As you run down the narrow stone tunnel, you look down a corridor to your right - and see a wizard freezing a skeleton. To your left, a warrior beheading a zombie. You begin to worry that all the good fights are claimed.</p>
    <p>Distracted, you run right into...</p>
