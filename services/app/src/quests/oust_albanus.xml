    <p>Your party arrives in Gruyere, a small plains town known for their cheese. The townspeople emerge and see you - they stamp towards you, furious.</p>
    <p>"He's gone and taken it! He's taken it all!"</p>
    <p>You attempt to console them, and ask for clarification.</p>
    <p>"Albanus! He's gone and stolen all of our cheese!"</p>
    <p>This simply won't do.</p>
    <choice text="Help the villagers recover their precious cheese.">
      <roleplay title="" data-line="16">
        <p>"Thank you!" they shout, weeping with joy. "That cheese is our livelihood here in Gruyere!"</p>
        <p>The small crowd pushes you towards the center of the road, gesturing towards an open manhole cover.</p>
        <p>"Albanus lives down there!"</p>
        <p>You're a bit unsure of where this is going, but you did agree to help them.</p>

            <p>Searching through the pockets of your fallen foes, you discover a worn map fragment that might solve this mystery.</p>
            <p>The fragment is a map of the town, with a big red X marked on several of the streets.</p>
            <p>Curious, you head to the nearest red X, finding an open manhole cover leading to the sewers below the town. The bandits must have come from down there.</p>

    <p>The sewers smell precisely as bad as you imagined them.</p>
    <p>But wafting on the air, you smell the distinctly foot-like stench of fresh Limburger. Albanus can't have gotten far.</p>
    <p>As you head deeper into the sewers, the light grows dark. A skittering sound ahead makes you think you're not the only one searching for a tasty morsel in these tunnels...</p>

        <p>Nope. That's just the sewers.</p>
        <p>As you clean your weapons, the shadows begin to recede. A tall torch-bearing figure shuffles towards you.</p>

    <p>[oust_albanus_png_full]</p>
    <p>You open bleary eyes and behold a small cavern in the sewers. Albanus and his cronies are huddled by a fire in the center of the room. You and your troupe are off in a corner, battered and wounded but still among the living.</p>

    <p>You begin searching for some way out of this mess. You managed to slip your bonds - the bandits aren't very good at tying knots - and you immediately see two ways to ruin their day.</p>
    <p>There's a small powder keg nearby. If it were to "accidentally" land in the fire, the walls would probably get a new coat of red paint. And soot.</p>
    <p>You also spy a giant rat in a cage, over in the corner. It looks malnourished and <i>very</i> hungry.</p>

        <p>The worry of setting off an explosion in a small, mostly-sealed room is dismissed from your mind as you grab the keg and lob it at the fire.</p>
        <p>You leap for cover as a blinding white light erupts, but are thrown to the wall, then to the ground by a massive wall of sound and heat.</p>
        <p>Rocks fall around you, but cheese - blasted high above by the explosion - falls as well. From the gaping hole in the ceiling you see the curious heads of the townsfolk gathering around to look at your stunned party and what is apparently a cheese-based weather phenomenon.</p>
        <p>From the corner, the startled Captain charges towards you.</p>
