<quest title="GM's Corner: A Shiny Score" data-line="0">
    <roleplay title="Setup" data-line="2">
        <p>This edition of the GM's Corner features a space heist. Before playing you will need to grab a paper and pen/pencil. Index Cards may be preferable to paper for the next component, but aren't necessary.</p>
        <p>Each player should write down their suggestion for the following story elements: 1. A rare or valuable thing no sane person wants.</p>
        <p>2. A compulsive behavior triggered by a common circumstance.</p>
        <p>3. The name of a criminal gang.</p>
        <p>Put those answers aside for the moment. They will be selected and chosen by the players as the quest continues.</p>

    <roleplay title="Introduction" data-line="14">
        <p>"'The Lady's Purse' is the finest spaceliner in twelve systems. Aristocrats, capitalists, and diplomats prefer her luxurious accommodations. Can you imagine the haul she carts to and fro? Gems and finery. Secret communications. The latest Quantum prototypes. It's enough to make a thief's heart flutter..." --Dolorous Davies, Shady Fellow</p>
        <p>"Out here in the Black it's every man, woman, or alien for themselves. You think you have partners? You'd be surprised how quick they'll turn on you, if things get desperate." Bill Ironhand, Maimed Space Pirate.</p>
    </roleplay>
    <roleplay title="Some Lady" data-line="21">
        <p>As your craft approaches, you must concede "The Lady's Purse" truly is a fine vessel.  Her sleek curves seem designed to make the most of every glint and glimmer afforded by any stellar lightsource. Don't mistake her lack of gunports for weakness, however. Power and privilege have outfitted this maiden with security that'd give a normal dreadnought pause.</p>
        <p>You must be crazy, desperate, or both, but you've agreed to hit "The Purse" and abscond with things of value. It'll either land you a godforsaken cell on the icy penal colony of Rura Penthe or be your ticket to notoriety and fortune.</p>
