    <p>Your adventure continues with <b>Expedition: The Future</b>.</p>

    <p>New in <b>The Future</b>: Skills</p>
    <instruction>
      <p>:skill: "Skills" are a new card type that help you succeed in mid-story skill checks, unlocking new paths. They can also be discarded during combat to activate a powerful, one-time boost.</p>
    </instruction>
    <instruction>
      <p>:skill: Skills have different core types (Knowledge, Athletics, Charisma). When prompted to make a skill check of the type listed on your card, add your current skill level to your roll.</p>
    </instruction>
    <instruction>
      <p>:skill: When you level up, you may now choose to learn (draw 3, keep 1) or level up a skill (by sliding your level up one marker, which may or may not increase the number) instead of drawing a new Ability.</p>
    </instruction>
    <instruction>
      <p>:skill: Skill levels persist across fights unless you choose to discard the skill for its single-use effect.</p>
    </instruction>
    <instruction>
      <p>:cards: For the purposes of this tutorial, each Adventurer should now draw three Skills, choose one, and return the others to the Skill deck.  Place your chosen Skill face-up next to your Adventurer and place a clip on its first level.</p>

    <p>After defeating the strange, terrible Hound and fleeing back to the guardhouse, you'd discovered the hastily scrawled note with the message:</p>
    <p>
      <i>I'm sorry for unleashing the horror. I tried to alter the future... but instead I scarred these lands - Peter</i>
    </p>
    <p>A pounding on the door makes you think you're still being pursued, and you flee to the back of the guardhouse. Desperate for a spot to hide, you open the first door you see - and are confronted with a large, silvery machine.</p>
    <p>The door opening causes it to whir to life, clanking loudly and shooting sparks everywhere.</p>
  </roleplay>
  <roleplay title="continue" data-line="32">
    <p>The doorway rends apart into some sort of rift... Through it, you see the pinprick points of starlight. The warmth and air are sucked from the room with explosive force.</p>
    <p>Before you can catch breath or turn to flee, you've been wrenched from your feet and pulled into the rift!</p>
  </roleplay>
  <roleplay title="continue" data-line="37">
    <p>The sensation of floating weightless might otherwise be pleasant, were there any air to draw into your desperately heaving lungs. A blinding light steals your vision, as a gel-like substance encapsulates your head...</p>
  </roleplay>
  <roleplay title="continue" data-line="40">
    <p>You wake up in a room with perfectly smooth, gray walls and no windows. A strange metal hexagon seems stuck to the back of your left hand. Lights pulse and play across its surface and you somehow "know" you've been selected as a specimen in an experiment. Other knowledge you never learned is also present in your mind...</p>

    <p>New in "The Future": Tech Abilities.</p>
    <instruction>
      <p>:tech: Tech abilities are a powerful way to gain and use Loot to help friends and harm foes. Adventurers with at least one Tech ability may learn new tech abilities when leveling up.</p>
    </instruction>
    <instruction>
      <p>:cards: Any Adventurer that did not start with a Tech ability may draw one now.</p>

    <p>The metal door to the cell silently retracts into the ceiling, leaving a darkened corridor before you.</p>
