    <p>Your party is a group of crusaders of the Order of Retribution, a holy order tasked with eliminating the undead presence that has recently grown across the land. An order has come from your superiors of a mission in the distant town of Brustwick, but your purpose there is unknown.</p>
    <p>Your contact for this mission is Brother Pell, a confidant and long-time friend who lives in Brustwick and knows much about goings-on in the town and the surrounding area.</p>

  <roleplay icon="adventurer" title="Arrival" data-line="12">
    <p>After several days' journey, you make it to the outskirts of the town just as the sun begins to set.</p>
    <p>As you walk towards Pell's house, you look around you; the run-down and dilapidated buildings loom imposingly, a fine mist rises from the ground, and a musty, moldy odor permeates the place.</p>
    <p>You find Pell's home and knock at the door, anxious to get inside.</p>
  </roleplay>
  <roleplay title="Brother Pell" data-line="20">
    <p>The door creaks open, and Brother Pell ushers your group in.</p>
    <p>Pell is... not what you expected. The joyous face you remember feasting, training, and fighting with in the Order has been replaced by a haggard, sickly one with sallow, sunken eyes.</p>
    <p>You ask in alarm what's been happening to the town; he invites you to sit, and begins a haunting story.</p>
  </roleplay>
  <roleplay icon="undead" title="The Mistress" data-line="28">
    <p>Pell tells the story of Mistress Malaise, an influential aristocrat who until recently had been vying for governance of the town. Despite her credentials, she was not a member of the governor's family and didn't stand a chance at inheriting the position. Decade after decade of rejection brewed a bitter hate for the ruling family, as well as an unquenchable ambition.</p>
    <p>After one final attempt, she vanished. Many assumed her dead - and over time the governor and his family began to grow ill, as did the entire town. When they died, Malaise emerged into prominence once more with the last will of the governor, stating that she was to rule.</p>
    <p>Ever since then, the town has grown more blighted, townsfolk have fallen ill, decayed bands of the undead are spotted on the town outskirts, and Malaise herself has aged backwards in time, becoming hauntingly beautiful.</p>
    <p>The evidence is clear: Malaise has become an immortal lich.</p>
  </roleplay>
  <roleplay icon="d20" title="The Job" data-line="38">
    <p>After days of spying on Malaise, Pell believes he has found her phylactery - the magical vessel in which she stored her soul when she became undead.</p>
    <p>The phylactery must be kept close to the lich and the spell renewed frequently, and Pell has seen her take frequent trips to the mausoleum of the governor. The place is shrouded in wards, trap spells, and magical locks that can only be designed to keep everyone away from something very valuable.</p>
    <p>If your party can travel to the mausoleum and find the phylactery, Pell can perform the unbinding ritual to release the soul from its container and make Malaise capable of being slain.</p>
    <p>You begin the hunt immediately.</p>
  </roleplay>
  <roleplay icon="bandit" title="Outside the Tomb" data-line="50">
    <p>The moist soil squishes underfoot as you enter the graveyard - the musty smell is much stronger here.</p>
    <p>It doesn't take long to spot the mausoleum. At the center of the graveyard rises a large and stately stone structure, very new-looking compared to the other headstones.</p>
    <p>Lurking near the entrance to the mausoleum, you find three stealthy-looking figures. They appear to be gathering up the courage to venture inside.</p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
    <choice text="Call out to them.">
      <roleplay title="" data-line="62">
        <p>You shout out to them, announcing your presence. They appear startled and disappear inside.</p>
        <p>Not too long after, the screams begin.</p>
        <p>As you make it to the door, you hear a small explosion, a sickening crunching sound, and then silence. The Order doesn't pay you nearly enough for this.</p>
      </roleplay>
      <roleplay icon="undead" title="Inside the Tomb" data-line="68">
        <p>You take a last deep breath of the damp air outside and venture within.</p>
        <p>As you go deeper, you find each of the three bandits in turn, victim to the magical traps and wards set up by Malaise. You try not to think of the state the bodies are in, but make careful note of how they died and safely navigate the dangers of the outer rooms.</p>
        <p>Towards the end of a long corridor, you find one last door into the mausoleum's innermost chamber. You hear a creaking sound as you press against the door - but the noise didn't come from the door...</p>

    <p>The moving headstone is actually an old, feeble woman, who was apparently waiting for you to emerge. She calls herself Malaise, and begs for you to listen.</p>

        <p>With a wistful smile, she opens the box you looted from the mausoleum and reveals an empty glass bottle. Pell must have warded the grave and planted the false phylactery as a trap for adventurers to distract them from his real identity.</p>
